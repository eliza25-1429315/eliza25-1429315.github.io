    	<p>Hama Hama is a fifth generation family-run shellfish farm on Washingtonâ€™s Olympic Peninsula. Our beds are located at the mouth of one of the shortest, coldest, and least developed rivers in Washington State, and that purity is reflected in the clean, crisp flavor of the oysters downstream.</p>
    	<p>We sell our oysters at our farm store and oyster saloon, at two Seattle Farmers Markets, and direct to consumers and chefs across the nation. Our mission is pretty simple: utilize low impact farming methods to grow world-class oysters, have fun, and leave something good for the next guy.</p>
